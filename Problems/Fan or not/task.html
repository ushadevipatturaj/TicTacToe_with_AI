  <p>A bunch of friends got together to watch an esports tournament. There are those who have already decided on their favorite team and those who are just interested in watching the competition.</p> 
  <p>Write a function <code class="java">add_viewer()</code> that will take a person's name and add it to the fan list if they already know which team they will root for. <strong>Return</strong> the list of all fans. If the person has not yet decided, then a new list should be created for them.</p> 
  <p>If a person <em>has </em>their favorite team, then, together with the name of the person, a list containing names of all other fans will be passed as an argument to the function. If not, only the person's name will be given. Think about the default value for the list.</p> 
  <p>You do <em>NOT</em> have to handle input or call a function, just implement it.</p>
